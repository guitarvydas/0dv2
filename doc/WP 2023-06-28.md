- make generated keywords special and distinct from other ids
	- surround keywords with unicode brackets, e.g. `‹def›`
- make generated formals lists distinct from other lists, e.g. `❲a b c❳`
- change indent/dedent characters to unicode `⇢` and `⇠` resp.
- PEG matches on single runes, compounds need to be delimited by runes
	- compounds = ids and strings and keywords and comments and numbers and multi-char operators and symbol (id / keyword)


suggested Unicode runes:
`“...”` strings
`❲...❳` symbols
`‹...›` keywords
`⟨...⟩` numbers
`⎣...⎦` comments
`⟪...⟫` multi-char operators
`⇢` indent
`⇠` dedent
`・` spaces/tabs in original
`⦚` newlines in original
