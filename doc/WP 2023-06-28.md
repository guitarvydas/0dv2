- make generated keywords special and distinct from other ids
	- surround keywords with unicode brackets, e.g. `‹def›`
- make generated formals lists distinct from other lists, e.g. `❲a b c❳`
- change indent/dedent characters to unicode `⇢` and `⇠` resp.
- PEG matches on single runes, compounds need to be delimited by runes
	- compounds = ids and strings and keywords and comments and numbers and multi-char operators and symbol (id / keyword)
