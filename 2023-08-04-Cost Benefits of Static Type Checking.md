### Summary

The document discusses the benefits of static type checking from the perspective of users rather than developers. While type checking helps improve development efficiency, it only indirectly benefits user experience. The author argues that more resources should be focused on addressing actual user experience issues, which would provide more value for users. The examples of cost savings from type checking improvements are simplified assumptions that ignore other factors that impact user value. Overall, the key point is that user needs and experience should be prioritized over developer productivity when evaluating the benefits of technical improvements.

### Key Moments
- The focus should be on quantifying the benefits of static type checking in terms of user cost savings, not developer time savings.  
  
- Simple calculations can be done to estimate the potential user cost savings from improvements in developer time.  
  
- Even small improvements in developer time can translate to meaningful cost savings for users.  
  
- Type checking indirectly helps user experience by improving developer experience.  
  
- There is more potential value in focusing on fixing user experience issues directly.  
  
- Expertise is not just about using quantitative methods, but also experience and skill in a domain.  
  
- Simplifying assumptions are made to make calculations tractable.  
  
- Focusing on fixing user experience issues provides the greatest value.  
  
- Scientists often make simplifying assumptions to model complex phenomena.  
  
- Collaborate with user experience experts, but don't rely solely on computer science experts to design user experiences.
